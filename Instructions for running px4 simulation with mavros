About, how to go about simulating the control law made on MATLAB and implement it over here

	terminal 1:
		./px4_sim/runGazeboSim.sh
		let the gazebo simulation load first then
	terminal 2: 
		roslaunch mavros px4_Sim.launch
	start QGroundControl from the Desktop or run
		./Desktop/QGroundControl.AppImage & : any prompt that comes just do ctrl+c


____________________
Waypoint following:
	-the catkin_ws is inside the folder catkin_wsPX4
	-rosrun pub_waypoints publish_WP.py 
		: this will publish the waypoints to the rostopic /mavros/setpoint_position/local
	- on the terminal with runGazeboSim.sh, 
		-commander takeoff
		-commander mode offboard

____________________
Direct actuator control: control group 0, used roll, yaw, pitch, throttle forces: mapped according to motor mapping:
	-rosrun pub_waypoints publish_forces.py
	-on the terminal with runGazeboSim.sh,
		-commander takeoff
		- commander mode offboard 	 

Note: 'Lockstep' has to be disabled for actuator control: https://dev.px4.io/master/en/simulation/#lockstep-simulation
 -disable Firmware/boards/px4/sitl/default.cmake : set (Enable ... yes->no)
 -iris.base.xacro : enable_lockstop: true-> false
 -iris.sdf:  <enable_lockstep>false</enable_lockstep>
 	the above file is in tools: sitl_gazebo/models/iris/iris.sdf


Asphalt floor is deleted: in the file 'empty.world' :  which is mentioned in the launch file
