SETTING UP VICON

To set up the vicon connection to recieve data from the main vicon pc, follow the following steps:
	1. switch on the vicon system on the main pc: frequency 30-50Hz
	2. Use a usb to ethernet adapter on an another port of the main pc to connect the pc to the lan
	3. after logging into the internet, note down the ip address of the system
	4. On the laptop conected to the lan via wifi or lan ping the ip address, see if the packets are recieved
	5. start the vicon tracker on the main pc
	6. in the vicon_bridge package on ros, find the launch file and set the ip address to be <ip address of the system set earlier>:801
		7. run roscore(NO NEED)
	8. run the roslaunch file following instructions from http://wiki.ros.org/vicon_bridge
	9. Ensure that the robot's x axis and world's x axis align together in the beginning so that the external position fusion works properly(initial yaw and yaw reported by pixhawk equals zero)

INITIALIZING MAVLINK COMMUNICATION

-attach the telemetry module to the pc with mavros 

-ls /dev/tty*: to look at the list of serial ports, ttyUSBx something like this)
			https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/debug/system_console.html#linux--mac-os-screen

- To establish mavlink via mavros:(There is no need to follow the tabbed lines)

		- start roscore 
		- go to catkin_ws/src/mavros/mavros/launch/
		- if you have apm or px4 loaded, select the appropriate px4.launch or the other
		- in the launch file, in the tags fcu_url: <address of the port>:baud rate, address of the usb port could be found by ls /dev/tty*, baud rate 57600
	- roslaunch mavros px4.launch : run this in terminal

		- remeber that the above commannd doesn't run with connection already established with qgroundcontrol. So close QGC and then run the above: FIXED in the launch file with the address of udp which is detedted by qgc(see starting qgc in the part below)

Transporting data from ros vicon bridge to mavlink
- An example of using vicon data 
https://404warehouse.net/2015/12/20/autopilot-offboard-control-using-mavros-package-on-ros/
- set the ip address to 10.110.146.15:801(the main machine) the address of main vicon pc

_______________________________________________________
Getting vicon data into px4

	-USING plugin: 'vision_pose_estimate' (look at px4.config for parameters)

	-Ensure the coordinates are coming in ENU frame from vicon system
		https://dev.px4.io/master/en/ros/external_position_estimation.html#ros_reference_frames

	-In the vicon launch file: parent_frame has been declared as /world and in the vicon software name of the quadcopter object has been kept to be quad: so the child_frame(tf) is mostly 'quad' or 'vicon/quad' check it
	-in the px4.config
		-under 'vision_pose':
			vision_pose:
			  tf:
			    listen: true           # enable tf listener (disable topic subscribers)
			    frame_id: "world"
			    child_frame_id: "vicon/quad" #CHECK THIS
			    rate_limit: 40.0
		change these parameters as required
	
	-CHange the EKF parameters as follows: 
	https://dev.px4.io/master/en/ros/external_position_estimation.html#ekf2-tuningconfiguration
		-EKF2_AID_MASK=vision_position, vision_way, external_vision_rotation (not sure about vision velocity and external vision: check in ekf2 implementation documentation or trial and error)
		- Look at the other parameters

	-check this before first flight:
		https://dev.px4.io/master/en/ros/external_position_estimation.html#check-external-estimate

starting qgc along with mavros

    Open QGroundControl Station, and click the "Q" icon on the top left, entering "Preferences" panel
    Click "General" on the left, then find "Autoconnect to the following devices:", opt out "SiK Radio", and opt in "UDP"
    Close QGroundControl to ensure that it is disconnected from the FCU
    Edit the px4.launch file, which is found in the Mavros package folder, add "udp://:14560@127.0.0.1:14550", 14560 and 14550 are any unused ports
    Run roslaunch mavros px4.launch
    Open QGroundControl

Now a chain FCU <---telemetry---> MAVROS <---UDP---> QGC is established

for visualization of the system on your pc use rviz
- roslaunch mavros_extras rviz_visual.launch: change the launch default parameters in the launch file
- rosrun rviz rviz: 
- add tf frame
